## How to enable WordPress Plugin or Theme licensing

With Labs64 NetLicensing, it’s incredibly easy to enable license management for any software product, whether you’re selling a WordPress plugin, theme, desktop app, or even SaaS and IoT products.

PluginPass is a WordPress license manager that makes it easy to monetize your WordPress plugins and themes.

It’s simply a plugin, which you easily define as a dependency to your plugin or theme, so this takes care of the plugin's activation and validation.
